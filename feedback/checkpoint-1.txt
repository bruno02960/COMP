CHECKPOINT 1 FEEDBACK
=====================
Class 5 - Group 52

High-priority:
	- Some node values are constructed with string concatenations that seem unnecessary:
		- e.g., Term(), Function(), ArrayElement()
	- In While(), the operation "if (L_Chaveta != null)" could be more cleanly implemented by separating the body of the "try" into 2 separate "try/catch" blocks.

Low-priority:
	- Stop after the first 10 parser errors
	- Consider outputting "prettier" (i.e., cleaner and more informative) error messages.
	- Consider rewriting the grammar to avoid use of LOOKAHEADs.
